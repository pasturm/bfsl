Description: How to fit a straight line through a set of points with errors in
  both coordinates? The bfsl package provides unbiased estimates of the intercept, 
  slope and standard errors for the best-fit straight line to independent points 
  with (possibly correlated) normally distributed errors in both x and y 
  (York, 2004 <doi:10.1119/1.1632486>). Other commonly used errors-in-variables 
  methods, such as orthogonal distance regression, geometric mean regression or 
  Deming regression are special cases of the bfsl solution.
