Description: Provides the solution from York (1968) <doi:10.1016/S0012-821X(68)80059-7>
  for fitting a straight line to bivariate data with errors in both coordinates.
  It gives unbiased estimates of the intercept, slope and standard errors of the
  best-fit straight line to independent points with (possibly correlated) 
  normally distributed errors in both x and y. Other commonly used 
  errors-in-variables methods, such as orthogonal distance regression, geometric
  mean regression or Deming regression are special cases of Yorkâ€™s solution.
