Description: How to fit a straight line through a set of points with errors in
  both coordinates? The 'bfsl' package implements the York regression 
  (York, 2004 <doi:10.1119/1.1632486>). It provides unbiased estimates of the 
  intercept, slope and standard errors for the best-fit straight line to 
  independent points with (possibly correlated) normally distributed errors in 
  both x and y. Other commonly used errors-in-variables methods, such as 
  orthogonal distance regression, geometric mean regression or Deming regression
  are special cases of the 'bfsl' solution.
